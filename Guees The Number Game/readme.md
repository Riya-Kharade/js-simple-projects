## 💡 How It Works

1. User enters a max number (e.g. 50).
2. Game randomly selects a number between 1 and that max.
3. User makes a guess:

   * 📉 Too low → shows low hint image
   * 📈 Too high → shows high hint image
   * 🎉 Correct → shows celebration gif
4. "Quit" button lets user end the game.
